This is the frontend application for Veganeiro, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Current Status

We have completed **Phase 1: Landing Page and Authentication**. The following tasks have been accomplished:

- Fixed dependency versions:
  - Updated TailwindCSS to v3.4.1
  - Updated PostCSS to v8.4.35

- Implemented core pages:
  - Landing page with hero section, features, about, and newsletter sections
  - Authentication pages (login, signup, forgot-password)
  - Dashboard page structure

- Improved accessibility:
  - Added proper autocomplete attributes to all form inputs
  - Implemented responsive navigation
  - Added proper ARIA labels and roles

The landing page is now fully functional with proper routing and improved accessibility features. The next phase will focus on implementing the backend integration and user authentication flow.
