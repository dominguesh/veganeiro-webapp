# Simplified Branch Strategy Implementation

## Changes
- Simplified branch strategy to a clear three-tier system
- Updated documentation with detailed branch roles and workflows
- Clarified protection rules for each core branch
- Streamlined deployment process documentation

## Core Branches
1. `main` üîß: Primary development branch
2. `moon` üåï: Staging environment
3. `earth` üåç: Production environment

## Benefits
- Reduces complexity in development workflow
- Eliminates redundant branches (removed develop branch)
- Clearer deployment pipeline
- Simplified merge strategy
- Better maintainability

## Migration Steps
1. Merge existing feature branches to `main`
2. Archive or delete redundant branches
3. Update branch protection rules
4. Update team documentation and processes

## Testing
- No code changes, only documentation and process updates
- Branch protection rules tested
- Deployment workflows verified

## Checklist
- [x] Updated branch strategy documentation
- [x] Reviewed branch protection rules
- [x] Verified deployment workflows
- [x] Updated cleanup automation
- [ ] Team approval
- [ ] Migration plan reviewed

## Additional Notes
This change simplifies our Git workflow while maintaining all necessary safety measures for staging and production deployments. The three-tier system provides a clear path from development to production while ensuring proper testing and validation at each stage.
